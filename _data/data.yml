    title: Career Profile
    summary: |
      I am a former journalist who, in 2019, took a job with Shopify in order to forge a new career path in tech. 
      My time there inspired to learn more about backend systems, and so in 2020 I began a software development course and this year I earned a Diploma in Full Stack Software Development. 

education:
    - Course: Full Stack Software Development
      Institute: Code Institute, 
      time: 2020 - 2021

        I studied remotely with Code Institute, Europe & UK's only university credit-rated coding bootcamp.

experiences:
    - role: Project Manager
      time: 2019-2020
      company: SpunOut, Dublin
      details: |
        • The brief of this fixed term project (which lasted 5 months) was to compile a database of signposts for a new service called the Crisis Text Line, which provides text support to people in crisis. This also involved updating, editing and verifying the existing SpunOut service listings (which appear on the site’s Help section) as the two organisations are run by a single parent company.
        • The project itself was divided into several strands. The first involved verifying existing SpunOut listings by contacting the 600+ services/organisations listed on the site. This required reaching out to the respective services by email and phone to confirm that details were correct. Once that was done, I researched the services in greater detail to determine whether they met the predetermined criteria (that they be a recognised charity or state body, have clear funding streams, adhere to the company ethos, that they be free/ affordable, nationally available, and where possible GDPR compliant).
        • Once those details were confirmed, I initiated a mailing campaign and automated system using a combination of Mailchimp, Zapier and Insightly (CRM) to enable the services to update their own listings in ‘real time’ going forward, removing the need to manually verify each services’ details on a regular basis. This automation will save great time and effort going forward.
    - role: Guru
      time: 2018-2019
      company: Shopify, Remote
      details: |

        Consistently exceeded biweekly performance evaluations measuring quality and progress towards financial targets.
        Delivered stellar customer service and supported struggling merchants in making sales by providing education on marketing strategies.
    - role: Assistant Editor
      time: 2007-2018

      details: |
